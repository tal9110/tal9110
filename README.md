<p align="center">The AlloSphere is a three-story facility at the University of California, Santa Barbara that uses multiple modalities to represent large and complex data, including immersive visualization, sonification, and interactivity. I was commisioned to create a 3D interactive virtual tour of the facility and wrote an audio-reactive score that follows the user throughout the website.</p>
